# StudySmarterTestTask

The task:
```
As a preparation, we would ask you to implement the attached Mockup as an Angular component. The component should display the weekdays and highlight the current day.
```
The mockup is located in `src/app/assets`

The solution does not support IE11.

## How to run

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
